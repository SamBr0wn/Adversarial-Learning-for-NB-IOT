Simulation Instructions:

*Requires Reinforcement Learning and LTE Toolboxes

- To train the initial victim agent, run 'pretrain_victim_script.m'
- To train the jammer agent, run 'pretrain_jammer_script.m'
- To train the defensive victim agent, run 'victim_defense_script'

- To run NB-IOT simulation, run 'main_script'
	- Adjust 'doSim' to control whether NB-IOT sim runs
	- Adjust 'numTrials' to control the number of time steps
	- Adjust 'run_with_jammer' to control whether the jammer is present
	- Adjust 'run_with_fortified_victim' to control whether the initial victim or defensive victim is used
